index.js
This file is the entry point for the React application. It renders the App component and wraps it in a BrowserRouter component, which provides routing functionality to the application.

App.js
This file is the main component of the application and renders the different pages based on the URL. It uses Route components from the react-router-dom library to render different components based on the URL. It also includes a Switch component to ensure that only one component is rendered at a time. The App component includes the following pages:

Home: This component is rendered when the user visits the root URL ("/"). It displays a welcome message and a link to the all the navbar pages.
Jobs: This component displays current job openings for the company. It uses data from the jobs.js file to render job postings.
Contact: This component displays contact information for the company, including an email address and phone number.
About: This component displays information about the company, including its history and mission statement.
jobs.js
This file contains an array of objects, each representing a job posting. Each job posting includes an ID, image, title, location, description, requirements, and a link to apply. The Jobs component uses this data to render the job postings.

The map component in jobs.js is used to iterate over the jobsData array and create a new set of elements for each object in the array.

Specifically, the map function creates a new array of React elements by applying a given function to each element in the original array. In this case, the map function is being used to create a new set of div elements for each object in the jobsData array.

Each div element has a class of job and a key attribute with a unique identifier generated from the id field of the corresponding job object. Inside each div element, there are two columns - one for the job information and another for the job requirements.

The job information is displayed using the title, images, and location fields of the corresponding job object, while the job requirements are displayed using the description and requirements fields of the same job object.

In summary, the map component in jobs.js is responsible for dynamically generating a set of job listing elements based on the data in the jobsData array.

This file contains the navigation bar for the application. It includes links to the different pages of the application and a sign out button.

This component displays a welcome message and a link to the Jobs page.
