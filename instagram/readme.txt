An Instagram clone website aims to provide a social media platform that imitates Instagram's features and functionalities. 
With the ability to share photos and videos, follow other users, like and comment on posts, among others, Instagram has 
become a highly popular social media platform. An Instagram clone website would similarly offer these features and allow 
users to share their media, follow others, and engage with their community.

There are several reasons why one might choose to use an Instagram clone website, including the creation of a new social
media platform that caters to a specific niche or community. Additionally, some users may be looking for alternatives to
Instagram, either because they are dissatisfied with the platform or simply looking for something different.
